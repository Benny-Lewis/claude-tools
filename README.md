# claude-tools

Personal Claude Code customizations — skills, statuslines, hooks, and agents.

## Skills

### `/cleanup-notepad`

Triage unsaved Notepad++ tabs. Reads backup files, cross-references against existing project files, and categorizes each as save or delete.

- Reads `session.xml` to identify only currently open tabs
- Checks for duplicates, completed work, temporary pastes, and AI-generated scratch
- Proposes save locations using existing directory structure
- Waits for approval before saving anything

### `/file`

Open a file's containing folder in the system file manager with the file selected.

```
/file package.json
/file the main config
/file src/components/Header.tsx
```

- Resolves filenames, paths, natural language descriptions, or infers from context
- Cross-platform: Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, Linux xdg-open

## Statuslines

Two interchangeable Claude Code statusline configs, managed by a switcher script.

| Name | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| `ben` | Git branch (clickable), staged/modified counts, context bar, token counts, session cost, duration, lines +/- |
| `monitor` | 5h/7d API quota usage with progress bars, reset countdown, context bar, tokens, optional pacing |

### Switching

```bash
# Show which statusline is active
python statuslines/switch-statusline.py

# Switch to a specific one
python statuslines/switch-statusline.py ben
python statuslines/switch-statusline.py monitor
```

Restart Claude Code after switching.

### How it works

The switcher updates the `statusLine.command` field in `~/.claude/settings.json` to point at the selected statusline script. Both scripts live in `statuslines/` — your custom one (`ben-custom.js`) is tracked in this repo, and `claude-usage-monitor/` is a cloned third-party tool (gitignored).

```

## Install

As a Claude Code plugin (for skills):

```
/plugin marketplace add Benny-Lewis/claude-tools
/plugin install claude-tools
```

The statuslines are used directly from this repo via the switcher — no separate install step.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI with an active subscription
- Python 3.10+ (for statusline switcher and claude-usage-monitor)
- Node.js (for `ben` statusline)
